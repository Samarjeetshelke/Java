**Polymorphism**
---
Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. 
The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.
There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.

The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

Real life example of polymorphism: A person at the same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.

Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.

In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:
1.Compile time Polymorphism
2.Runtime Polymorphism
1. Compile-time polymorphism: It is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. But Java doesn’t support the Operator Overloading.

Java does not support operator overloading due to the following reasons −

Makes code complex − In case of operator overloading the compiler and interpreter (JVM) in Java need to put an extra effort to know the actual functionality of the operator used in a statement.
Programming error − Custom definition for the operators creates confusion for the programmers especially the new developers. Moreover, while working with programming languages that support operator overloading the program error rate is high compared to others.
Easy to develop tools like IDEs − Removal of operator overloading concept keeps the language simple for handling and process leading to a number of Integrated development environment in Java.
Method overloading − The functionality of operator overloading can be achieved in Java using method overloading in Java in a simple, error free and clear manner.
