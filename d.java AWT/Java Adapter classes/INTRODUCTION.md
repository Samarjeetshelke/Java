**Java Adapter Classes**<br>
<br>
Java adapter classes provide the default implementation of listener interfaces. If you inherit the adapter class, you will not be forced to provide the implementation of all the methods of listener interfaces. So it saves code.
<br>
<br>
**Pros of using Adapter classes**:<br>
<br>
-It assists the unrelated classes to work combinedly.<br>
-It provides ways to use classes in different ways.<br>
-It increases the transparency of classes.<br>
-It provides a way to include related patterns in the class.<br>
-It provides a pluggable kit for developing an application.<br>
-It increases the reusability of the class.<br>
<br>The adapter classes are found in java.awt.event, java.awt.dnd and javax.swing.event packages. The Adapter classes with their corresponding listener interfaces are given below.
